If you’re a STEM student, you might be already sick of those mandatory humanities classes. *“Why should an ECE student care about ‘What is art’?”* *“Why do I need to remember when William conquered the Normans?”* Well well well, hold on hold on. Maybe it’s time to step outside the world of science. Humanities are actually more useful than you think. In fact, they could be the missing piece that helps us solve those complicated real-world problems. Here are four reasons why STEM students should give humanities a chance, and how interdisciplinary learning can better prepare us for our future career.

## 1. Real-World Problems Don't Stick to One Discipline

Climate change, AI ethics and Pandemic Prevention—none of these challenges can be solved with just code or functions. Real-world issues require knowledge from multiple fields: technology, ethics, culture, economy, etc. A narrow STEM lens can’t capture the full scene. Humanities and interdisciplinary education teaches us how to integrate ideas across different disciplines, and how to view challenges through a human-centered lens. Instead of being confined to a single-discipline mindset, we can think more openly, better integrate knowledges and generate more creative solutions.

## 2. Humanities Help You Understand Real-World Problems

In engineering, we’re trained to solve problems. But in the real world, the first and probably the hardest part isn’t solving it, but *defining* what the problem actually is. Like hunting a rabbit––you can't catch it before you've found it. Real-world problems are often ill-structured. Here's a simple example: reminding the elderly to take the medication. A STEM student might develop a high-tech device. However, if they thoroughly investigate the problem, they might find that what really works is just a clear, carefully-labeled pill box. Humanities train us to think critically and empathetically to discover the essence of a problem.

## 3. Interdisciplinary Methods Lead to Better Source Integration

Through interdisciplinary learning, we gain the ability to move freely across different fields, connect diverse knowledge, and integrate ideas for creative solutions. It equips us not only with critical thinking, but also with the ability to integrate multiple sources and perspectives for problem-solving. Feedback from [Kao's interdisciplinary course](#kao) showed that students became more aware of how different perspectives interact, as well as how to blend them.

## 4. Real Solutions Must be Human-Centered

As STEM students, we’re often trained to maximize performance and optimize efficiency. But in real-world, this approach alone is not enough. Real-world challenges like climate change require more than technologies—they require an understanding of humans, cultures, values, and some long-term consequences. That’s where humanities step in. Interdisciplinary education helps us develop a human-centered mindset. We'll learn to ask ourselves after trained with interdisciplinary methods: *Who is this solution for? What are the social and ethical trade-offs?* Interdisciplinary education equips us with not just skills to build, but the wisdom and responsibility to build inclusively, comprehensively and empathetically for human beings.
